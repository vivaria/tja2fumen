def processTJACommands(tja):
    """
    Merge TJA 'data' and 'event' fields into a single measure property, and split
    measures into sub-measures whenever a mid-measure BPM change occurs.

    The TJA parser produces measure objects with two important properties:
      - 'data': Contains the note data (1: don, 2: ka, etc.) along with spacing (s)
      - 'events' Contains event commands such as MEASURE, BPMCHANGE, GOGOTIME, etc.

    However, notes and events can be intertwined within a single measure. So, it's
    not possible to process them separately; they must be considered as single sequence.

    A particular danger is BPM changes. TJA allows multiple BPMs within a single measure,
    but the fumen format permits one BPM per measure. So, a TJA measure must be split up
    if it has multiple BPM changes within a measure.

    In the future, this logic should probably be moved into the TJA parser itself.
