## Usage

tja2fumen is included as part of several existing projects. So, you may be using tja2fumen already!

- **XB1/TDMX**: [TakoTako](https://github.com/fluto/takotako) converts both chart and audio files for XB1/TDMX.
- **Nijiro**: [TaikoSoundEditor](https://github.com/NotImplementedLife/TaikoSoundEditor) converts both chart and audio files for NIjiro.

> **Note**: For older versions of TakoTako (3.2.0 and below), you can add tja2fumen by renaming `tja2fumen.exe` to `tja2bin.exe` and placing it inside TakoTako's plugin folder (`BepInEx/plugins/com.fluto.takotako/`).

You can also use tja2fumen directly on a `.tja` file by downloading `tja2fumen.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/vivaria/tja2fumen/releases) page and running `tja2fumen.exe file.tja` in a command prompt.

If a command is not listed, you can assume that it is unsupported. If you would like support for a missing command, please make a request by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/vivaria/tja2fumen/issues/new).

## Reporting bugs

If you've found a `.tja` file that tja2fumen converts incorrectly, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/vivaria/tja2fumen/issues/new) on the tja2fumen repo. 

It is especially important that you attach the song files to the issue. You can do this by adding the song files to a `.zip` (Select files -> Right click -> "Send to" -> "Compressed (zipped) folder"), and then uploading the `.zip` to the issue. This greatly helps me to reproduce and fix any issues.

You can also message me directly on Discord (`_vivaria`) if you don't have a GitHub account, and I will take care of making an issue for you. :)
